This is a log of progress

06/03:

  a) install Tahr to my laptop by booting with USB-install tahr. 
  b) use full install, also need to use gpartd to do partition to setup msdos boot flag.
  c) need to mount usb to allow copy files 
  d) need to install grub4dos to boot 
  e) install gcc cannot use ppm. 
  f) Need to download devx sfs from http://distro.ibiblio.org/puppylinux/puppy-tahr/iso/tahrpup%20-6.0-CE/
  g) Tahr is a very out of date system, my laptop cannot properly run firefox. commit github is somehow disabled. 
  h) This Tahr is a 32bit version which is abandoned by most of distribution. It is very hard to get support from Ubuntu 
      repositary as 32bits are usually no longer supported. 
  i) Installing gcc is not finished yet and I have to abort system as it get frozen.
  j) test github wrap mode
  k) setup github to add Carlos to notification list. And test notification.
